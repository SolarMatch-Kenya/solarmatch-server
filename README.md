# SolarMatch Server

This is the backend for the SolarMatch application. SolarMatch-KE is an AI-Powered Solar Suitability and Adoption Platform.
We help homeowners, businesses, and communities transition to clean energy through data-driven insights.

We are empowering Kenya to go solar â€” one rooftop at a time.

It provides a RESTful API to support the frontend application, handling user authentication, data processing, and interactions with the database and AI services.

- **RESTful API:** A well-structured API for all frontend operations.
- **User Management:** Secure user registration, login, and profile management.
- **Data Analysis:** Processes and analyzes data to provide solar suitability scores and other insights.
- **AI Integration:** Connects with Google's Gemini API to power the "Sunny" chatbot.
- **Database Management:** Uses SQLAlchemy and Alembic for database operations and migrations.
- **Installer Management:** Functionality for solar installers to manage their profiles and connect with homeowners.
